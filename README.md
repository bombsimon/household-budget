# Household Budget Manager

A comprehensive household budget management application built with React,
TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Designed to help individuals and couples manage
shared finances, track expenses, and plan for financial goals.

## About

For the longest time, I've been keeping track of my personal and household
budget in a Google Spreadsheet. Nothing wrong with that, it's just... not
pretty.

I got the idea to do yet another test with some AI coding and thought, _"Maybe I
can just feed the spreadsheet to Claude?"_ Well, I could. And it did something
at first, but not really what I wanted. From there, I spent days prompting,
hitting my 5 hour limit several days in a row. Getting so close, and then ending
up right back where I started.

Finally, after about a week, I have something that feels good enough to share.
Just to clarify, I've written 0 lines of this code. I only removed maybe 5
lines, and I wrote the About section in this README. The rest is just me
prompting and directing Claude to do what I meant. I think it turned out OK!

git clone <repository-url>
cd household-budget

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (uses local storage)
npm run dev
```

### Firebase Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For cloud persistence and multi-device syncing:

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Firebase configuration
3. Enable Firestore Database in your Firebase project
4. Deploy security rules: `npm run firebase:deploy:rules`

See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
npm run firebase:deploy

# Or deploy only hosting (faster updates)
npm run firebase:deploy:hosting
```

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev                       # Start development server
npm run build                     # Build for production
npm run build:github              # Build for GitHub Pages deployment
npm run preview                   # Preview production build
npm run lint                      # Run ESLint
npm run prettify                  # Format code with Prettier
npm run firebase:emulators        # Start Firebase emulators

### Maintenance Commands

#### Updating Swedish Tax Data

The application includes current Swedish municipality tax rates for accurate after-tax income calculations. To update this data:

```bash
# Update major municipalities only (faster, for testing)
npm run update-municipalities

# Update all 290 municipalities (comprehensive, for production)
node scripts/update-municipality-data.js --full
```

This script fetches current tax rates directly from Skatteverket's official API and updates the static fallback data used when the API is unavailable.

For detailed information about Swedish tax data integration, see [MUNICIPALITY_DATA.md](MUNICIPALITY_DATA.md).
